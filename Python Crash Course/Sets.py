# Weâ€™ll use sets for two main reasons. The first is that in is a very fast operation on sets.
# 1. If we have a large collection of items that we want to use for a membership test, a set
# is more appropriate than a list.
# 2. The second reason is to find the distinct items in a collection:
item_list = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
num_items = len(item_list) # 6
item_set = set(item_list) # {1, 2, 3}
num_distinct_items = len(item_set) # 3
distinct_item_list = list(item_set) # [1, 2, 3]
